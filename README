I used django to build a small web app to pull data from the three apis and store it in a database.
A table shows the list of phlemologists with their names, ratings, and pictures.  Their location is shown on google maps.

To run the server locally, and view the project, it is necessary to have python2.7 installed as well as pip, a program for install python libraries.  If this has been done, enter the following in the same directory as the file start_server.sh:
./start_server.sh
You may need to change the permissions of start_server.sh to be able to execute it (chmod 777 start_server.sh).
This should install django.  After this has completed, the dev server should start up, and you can ctrl click on the url to load it in your browser. Email me at chetweger@gmail.com if there are any issues running the server.
